    "In this project, our group, [group_name], created a metric to find the \"best\" neighborhood in Pittsburgh. Using databases that measure toxic water releases, [Jacob_data], baseball field listings and 2020 census data, we each made our own submetrics that find the best neighborhood in that particular regard. In this presentation, we'll go over each individual submetric, and explain how these metrics were combined for the final metric"
